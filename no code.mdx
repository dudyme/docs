## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Always test your integrations in a development environment before deploying to production.
</Tip>

1. **Error Handling**: Set up error handling for failed API calls
2. **Rate Limiting**: Be mindful of API rate limits when making multiple calls
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations (GDPR, TCPA, etc.)
4. **Testing**: Use test phone numbers and agents before going live
