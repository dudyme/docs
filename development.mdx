<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or higher).
</Info>

## Local Development Setup

Step 1. Install Mintlify CLI on your OS:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify
```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

Step 2. Navigate to the documentation directory (where `mint.json` is located) and run:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

The Call24x7 documentation website is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

Mintlify uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

You will see an error like this if you try to run Mintlify on a port that's already taken:

```md
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

## Updating Mintlify CLI

Each CLI is linked to a specific version of Mintlify. Please update the CLI if your local website looks different than production.

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Changes are automatically deployed to production when you push to the default branch.
</Tip>

You should see the following if the deployment successfully went through:

## Troubleshooting

Here's how to solve some common problems when working with the Call24x7 documentation.
