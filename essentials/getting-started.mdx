## Overview

This guide will help you get started with Call24x7.AI quickly. You'll learn how to set up your account, create your first AI agent, and make your first call.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Call24x7.AI developer account
- An API key from the [Developer Portal](https://call24x7.ai/developer)
- A phone number to test with (your own number is recommended for testing)

## Step 1: Create Your Account

1. Visit the [Call24x7.AI Developer Portal](https://call24x7.ai/developer)
2. Sign up for a new account
3. Verify your email address
4. Complete your profile setup

## Step 2: Get Your API Key

1. Navigate to the **API Keys** section in your dashboard
2. Click **Create New API Key**
3. Copy and securely store your API key

<Warning>
  Your API key is sensitive. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control. Use environment variables or secure secret management.
</Warning>

## Step 3: Create Your First Agent

An AI agent is the "personality" that handles your phone calls. You can create agents through:

- **Developer Portal**: Use the web interface to create and configure agents
- **API**: Create agents programmatically using the API

### Using the Developer Portal

1. Go to the **Agents** section
2. Click **Create New Agent**
3. Configure your agent:
   - **Name**: Give your agent a descriptive name
   - **Instruction**: Write the prompt that defines how your agent behaves
   - **Voice**: Select a voice model
   - **Language**: Choose the language for conversations

### Agent Instructions

The instruction/prompt is crucial - it defines how your agent will behave during calls. Example:

```
You are a friendly customer service representative for ABC Company. 
Your role is to:
- Greet customers warmly
- Answer questions about our products
- Schedule appointments when requested
- Be professional and helpful at all times
```

## Step 4: Make Your First Call

### Using the Developer Portal

1. Navigate to the **Send Call** page
2. Enter the recipient's phone number
3. Select your agent
4. Click **Send Call**

### Using the API

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.call24x7.ai/outbound_call \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to_phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "agent_id": "your-agent-id"
  }'
```

## Step 5: Monitor Your Calls

After initiating a call, you can:

- **View call status**: Check the status in your dashboard
- **Listen to recordings**: Access call recordings after completion
- **Review transcriptions**: Read full conversation transcripts
- **Set up webhooks**: Receive real-time notifications when calls complete
