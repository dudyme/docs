## Overview

All Call24x7.AI API requests require authentication using an API key. This guide explains how to obtain, use, and secure your API keys.

## Getting Your API Key

1. Sign in to the [Call24x7.AI Developer Portal](https://manage.call24x7.ai)
2. Navigate to the **API Keys** section
3. Click **Create New API Key**
4. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Production API Key" or "Development Key")
5. Copy the key immediately - it won't be shown again

<Warning>
  API keys are sensitive credentials. Store them securely and never expose them in client-side code, public repositories, or logs.
</Warning>

## Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of all API requests as a Bearer token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.call24x7.ai/outbound_call \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_1234567890abcdef" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "to_phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "agent_id": "agent-123"
  }'
```

## API Key Format

Call24x7.AI API keys follow this format:

- **Production keys**: Start with `sk_live_`
- **Test keys**: Start with `sk_test_`

## Best Practices

### Environment Variables

Store your API key in environment variables rather than hardcoding:

<CodeGroup>

```bash .env
CALL24X7_API_KEY=sk_live_1234567890abcdef
```

```javascript Node.js
const apiKey = process.env.CALL24X7_API_KEY;

fetch('https://api.call24x7.ai/outbound_call', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    to_phone_number: '+1234567890',
    agent_id: 'agent-123'
  })
});
```

```python Python
import os
import requests

api_key = os.getenv('CALL24X7_API_KEY')

response = requests.post(
    'https://api.call24x7.ai/outbound_call',
    headers={
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json={
        'to_phone_number': '+1234567890',
        'agent_id': 'agent-123'
    }
)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Key Rotation

Regularly rotate your API keys for security:

1. Create a new API key
2. Update your applications to use the new key
3. Test that everything works
4. Revoke the old key

### Multiple Keys

Create separate API keys for different environments or purposes:

- **Development**: For testing and development
- **Staging**: For staging environment
- **Production**: For live production use
- **Service-specific**: One key per service or application

## Error Responses

### Invalid API Key

If your API key is invalid or missing, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "error_code": "UNAUTHORIZED"
}
```

### Expired or Revoked Key

If your API key has been revoked or expired:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "API key has been revoked",
  "error_code": "UNAUTHORIZED"
}
```

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Store API keys in environment variables
- [ ] Never commit keys to version control
- [ ] Use different keys for different environments
- [ ] Rotate keys regularly
- [ ] Revoke unused or compromised keys immediately
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all API requests
- [ ] Monitor API usage for suspicious activity

## Rate Limits

API requests are subject to rate limiting based on your plan. If you exceed the rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

<Info>
  Rate limits are applied per API key. Contact support if you need higher limits.

    - Try creating a new key
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Key exposed in logs">
    If you've accidentally exposed your API key:
    1. Revoke the exposed key immediately
