## Welcome to the Call24x7.AI API

The Call24x7.AI API enables you to make AI-powered phone calls programmatically. Use our REST API to initiate outbound calls, handle inbound calls, and manage your AI agents.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.call24x7.ai
```

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

<Info>
  Get your API key from the [Call24x7.AI Developer Portal](https://manage.call24x7.ai).

```

## Error Codes

The API uses the following error codes:

## Webhooks

You can configure webhooks to receive notifications when calls complete. Include a `webhook_url` parameter in your call requests to receive call completion events.
